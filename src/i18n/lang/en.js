      "decision on the construction of a subway in the capital of the BSSR, the city of Minsk, was adopted by the Council of Ministers of the USSR on February 4, 1977. On May 3, 1977, the construction of the metro began, and on November 4, 1977, tunneling work began from the construction site of the future Park Chelyuskintsev station. On June 29, 1984, on the eve of the 40th anniversary of the liberation of Minsk from Nazi invaders during the Great Patriotic War, the regular movement of trains of the Minsk Metro began. The first line was launched from the Institute of Culture station to the Moskovskaya station, 7.84 kilometers long with eight stations and the Moskovskoye electric depot. The operation of the first section of the metro line showed the need to extend the branch, and in 1986 a section from the Moskovskaya station to the Vostok station with a length of 1.71 kilometers was put into operation.",
    label: "Archival images of the construction of the subway:",
    description02:
      "A distinctive feature of the construction of the Minsk metro was the shallow depth of the stations. Due to the high level of groundwater rise, the stations had to be placed literally under the earth's surface, at a depth of only 10-17 meters. The deepest station today is Yubileinaya Ploshchad, located at a depth of more than 25 meters. The operation of the first section of the metro line showed the need to extend the branch, and in 1986 a section from the Moskovskaya station to the Vostok station with a length of 1.71 kilometers was put into operation. Since 1985, the construction of the first section of the second metro line from the Traktorny Zavod station to the Frunzenskaya station has begun. Its length was 6.12 kilometers. In 1990, the first six stations of the Avtozavodskaya line were put into permanent operation.",

      "Back in the days of the existence of the USSR, about 150 large plants, factories and trusts were located in Minsk. It was extremely difficult for ground public transport to solve communication issues in the capital. Since the launch of the Minsk metro, this problem has been successfully solved, and the metro has become the most popular type of public transport. Already in the first year, more than 80 million people used its services.",

      "The second half of the 20th century was marked by rapid construction and industrial growth for Minsk. The city, which until recently was almost wiped off the face of the earth during the war years, developed rapidly: new plants and factories, educational and cultural institutions appeared, new residential areas were built. By the beginning of the 70s, about 140 enterprises worked in Minsk, including the flagships of the industry of the republic and the Union: a tractor and automobile plant, bearing, motor, gear plants, machine-tool plants, electronic computers and many others. Against the backdrop of the rapid development of Minsk, more and more people flocked to the metropolis.",

      "At the same time, this state of affairs has led to an increase in the volume of passenger traffic, average travel distances and a rapidly increasing load on the transport system in the city, to the point that the most significant city streets have exhausted their capacity. The main city highway - Leninsky Prospekt - did not escape this either.",
    description03:
      "In 1969, the main design organization of the city 'Minskproekt' developed a comprehensive scheme for the development of urban transport. Three options were considered to improve the challenging traffic environment: express bus, light rail and subway. As shown by simple calculations, the expansion of the tram and trolleybus network, as well as a significant replenishment of the ground transport fleet, will not be able to solve the problem. In a big city, with its complex and diverse economy, the load on land transport increases, and its speed inevitably decreases. Taking into account these circumstances and the specific development of Minsk, the option of introducing express buses directly to solve the transport problem could not be applied.",

      "But only the desire of the townspeople and the justification of the design institute was not enough. Such a project was supposed to receive support from the republican party bodies, and then be approved by the top leadership of the USSR. In addition, according to unspoken Soviet standards, only a city that reached the mark of 1 million inhabitants could apply for the metro. At that time, the population of Minsk was about 900 thousand. There were rumors that in order to achieve the coveted number, it was decided to artificially increase the number of inhabitants in the city - to attract people from the Belarusian regions, primarily young people to enter educational institutions, as well as military families. How these assumptions correspond to the truth is difficult to say, but the fact remains:",

The estimated cost of the project amounted to 119.3 million rubles, including the equity participation of the Minsk City Executive Committee - 9.64 million rubles.

Letters were sent to the Council of Ministers of the USSR for consideration by its chairman A. Kosygin. In the end, the intended goal was achieved, and on February 4, 1977, the Council of Ministers of the USSR issued an order to begin construction of the metro in Minsk. On May 3, 1977, many Minskers gathered near Chelyuskintsev Park to witness the historic event. In a solemn atmosphere, the first bucket of earth was extracted by an excavator, marking the beginning of the construction of the Minsk Metro.",
